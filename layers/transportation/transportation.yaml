layer:
  id: "transportation"
  description: |
      **transportation** contains roads and railways.
      This layer is directly derived from the OSM road hierarchy.
      At lower zoom levels major highways from Natural Earth are used.
      It contains all roads from motorways to primary, secondary and
      tertiary roads to residential roads and
      foot paths. Styling the roads is the most essential part of the map.
      The `transportation` layer also contains polygons for features like plazas.

          [`railway`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:railway) tag.
